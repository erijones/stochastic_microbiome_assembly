Stochastic microbiome assembly of the fruit fly microbiome
==========================================================

This directory contains raw data and companion code for the paper "Stochastic
community assembly of the Drosophila melanogaster microbiome depends on
context."


Contents
--------
+ raw_combinatorial_fly_microbiome_abundance_data.csv ...
    raw data file that contains microbial abundance data. Flies are fed
    combinations of bacterial species, then crushed and assayed after 10 or 15
    days. 48 fly replicates (3 technical replicates per biological replicate)
    are fed bacteria for each of 32 combinations of bacterial species.
+ stochastic_microbiome_assembly.py ...
    main python3 function that imports and analyzes microbiome abundance data,
    produces statistical models that reproduce observed colonization patterns,
    and generates manuscript figures.
+ figs/ ... directory that contains all figures generated by main python file
+ vars/ ... directory that stores results generated by main python file


Usage
-----
The main function of the python file stochastic_microbiome_assembly.py by
default runs code that generates Figs. 2, 3ab, 3c, 3d, and 4. Once the
repository is cloned, execute this file with
`python3 stochastic_microbiome_assembly.py`.

Several (nonstandard) dependencies are used in this python file:
+ Python modules statsmodels, pickle, and rpy2 must be installed
+ The statistical programming language R must be installed
+ In R the packages base, utils, and XNomial must be installed
